# Password-Generator

I created a password generator using HTML, styling with CSS and used JavaScript. This will generate 2 random passwords that are 15 characters long.

Creating this application helped me fine tune my skills and get a better undertanding on how to use arrays and a for loop in order to generate characters when called and/or when called at random.

In this future I will add more funcitonality to this application.
